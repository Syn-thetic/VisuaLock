    <string name="welcome_message">Dear User,\n\nWelcome to Visualock! We are delighted to have you onboard and thank you for choosing our service.\n\nVisualock offers a unique approach to securing your data using graphical passwords, allowing you to set personalized images as your passcodes. With our app, you can upload up to 36 images to create a robust and personalized security experience.\n\nTo get started, here\'s a brief guide on using the app:\n\n1. Navigate to the dashboard where you will find two main options.\n\n2. To set your custom password, upload your preferred image. You can upload a maximum of 36 images.\n\n3. Your uploaded images will be securely stored in Pass Storage.\n\n4. In Pass Storage, you will see a list of all your uploaded images. By toggling the switch, you can designate an image as your password.\n\n5. If you no longer need a particular image, you have the option to delete it.\n\n6. You can modify your email address (ensuring it is valid) and your username within the profile settings menu.\n\n7. When you forget your password, you must reset it via a text-based link sent to your email. After resetting, you\'ll need to log in with the text password as well. Upon successful login, you can access your storage to view your old password and reset the text password using an image.\n\nDeveloped by Minh Le, Steven Lin, Paridhi Mistry, Dylan Miranda, Karriem Muhammad, and Makeda Abebe.
